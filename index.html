<p> Mott Haven, The Bronx.- In the middle of the bustling streets of the Bronx, a group of indigenous migrant adults and children who belong to the group Red de Pueblos Transnacionales, gathers on the sidewalk of 146th Street. The music of drums and flutes begins to play while the group advances trying to coordinate their steps. </p>

<p>The Red de Pueblos Transnacionales, also known as 'La Red' among its members, is a collective of La Casa de los Pueblos, a Mott Haven-based nonprofit that serves as a bridge to connect other resource-focused organizations for migrants in New York. The organization has served as a space where indigenous migrants can find community through various activities, including dance.</p>

<p>La Red group dances 'Las Moras', which emerged during the colonial era in Mexico. This dance belongs to several indigenous communities in Puebla, including Teopantlán, home of some members of La Red, especially its co-founder and indigenous Nahuatl migrant, Esteban Estevez. </p>

<p>“We have used dance to bring our kids closer to our roots, their grandparents and family,” Estevez says. “We have also sent our children who were born here to Mexico, so that they know where we are from, where we come from and also so that they can value their culture.” </p>

<p> Here is why for the Hispanic and Latine indigenous migrants is important to keep their traditional dances from generation to generation, especially because they represent the biggest indigenous populations in The Bronx.</p>

            <p class="info-text">For 2020, according to data from the Government of New York, the Bronx was the bureau with the largest Hispanic and Latine population, with 54.8% of people identifying as part of this ethnicity.</p>

            <p class="info-text">In the Bronx, 30% of the population are Hispanic and Latine migrants, and just in Mott Haven, headquarters of La Red, 68% of the population identifies as Hispanic and Latine, making it the group with the largest population in the area.</p>

            <p class="info-text">Seven different Hispanic and Latine indigenous languages were identified in Mott Haven, which shows the Hispanic and Latine migrant indigenous demographic is also high. These indigenous languages are Mam, Mixtec, Náhuatl, Otomí, Q'anjob'al, Tlapanec y Zapotec.</p>

<p> Language and dance are intertwined as migrants and their descendants seek to continue preserving their roots. Such is the case of Jaslyne Estevez, Estevez's daughter, who at only 16 years old leads Las Moras dance group and who, despite being the first generation born in the United States, can speak a little of Nahuatl, the language from his father's native town. </p>

<p>“I have been dancing for about eight to nine years. The dance steps were taught to me by my father and a friend of his who was from his town, from Teopantlán, Puebla,” says Jaslyne and also mentions that, just like learning the dance of his father's town, so is the language. “I want to continue learning Nahuatl so I can talk to my grandmother, because she speaks more Nahuatl than Spanish.”</p>

<p>For many members of La Red, dance is a way in which they can continue to maintain their identity and get closer to their culture. A new member of the group, Irma García, took leave from work to come rehearse the dance and says she feels excited to participate, even though the dance does not belong to her town of Tenextepango in Morelos, Mexico.</p>

<p>“We should never lose your culture, we should always be proud of who we are,” says García. “Let them see that there are many of us and we have many traditions to show.” </p>
